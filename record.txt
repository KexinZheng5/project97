I edited the view/index.hbs which is the template of the page.

Also I edited the route/index.js which the rounte handle of the webpage.

I added a clas in the /questions.js. This is the place to hold all the questions when the server is running.

I need some help with the looking of the website.

Also we need the database for this, otherwise all the questions are only in the memory.
